ROS 2 Node Development Using rclpy and Serial Communication with Microcontrollers
=================================================================================

This tutorial documents a hands-on learning process focused on serial communication and control-oriented programming using Python and ROS 2. It explores how data flows between a microcontroller and a host computer, how timing, buffering, and parsing affect system behavior, and how software structure influences reliability. Rather than presenting only final results, this documentation emphasizes reasoning, common pitfalls, and practical debugging insights gained through experimentation. The goal is to build a clear mental model of how real-time-ish systems behave when software and hardware interact.
